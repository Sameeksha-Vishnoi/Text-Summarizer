# Text-Summarizer
Automatic text summarization, or just text summarization, is the process of creating a short and coherent version of a longer document.

Approaches of Summarization

1. Extractive Summarization - These methods rely on extracting several parts, such as phrases and sentences, from a piece of text and stack them together to create a summary. Therefore, identifying the right sentences for summarization is of utmost importance in an extractive method.

2. Abstractive Summarization - These methods select words based on semantic understanding, even those words did not appear in the source documents. It aims at producing important material in a new way. These methods use advanced NLP techniques to generate an entirely new summary.


This project is based on Extractive Approach.

Before running the code, we need to download a couple of libraries.
To do so execute the following command at the command prompt:

1. The first library is the 'beautiful soup' which is very useful Python utility for web scraping.

$ pip install beautifulsoup4

2. The second library is 'lxml' that we need to parse XML and HTML.

$ pip install lxml
